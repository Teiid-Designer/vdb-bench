When there are no data services and no data sources available in your workspace, here are the actions you can take:

*   ![altText](images/ConfigureDataSource.png "Configure Data Source") - You can create a new data source from one of the existing connections on your server. Go [here](svcsource-new-help.html) for more information on how to do that.

*   ![altText](images/ImportDataService.png "Import Data Service") - A data service can be imported into your workspace from a file or from a git repository. Go [here](dataservices-import-help.html) for more information on how to do that.
