<p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;font-size: 22">Teiid Settings</p>

The **Teiid Settings** page allows you to specify credentials for the **Admin** connection as well as the **JDBC** connection. This is required for connecting to the Teiid server as well as executing queries. 

The **Admin** connection is used for administrative server tasks. These credentials are very powerful and should never be given out to anyone that is not considered a super user or an administrator.

The **JDBC** connection is used for connecting to VDBs and executing queries. Additional roles can be assigned to users using this connection, such as OData and REST.  

See the [Teiid Console guide](https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/TEIID/Teiid+Console) for steps to create users and assign roles.
