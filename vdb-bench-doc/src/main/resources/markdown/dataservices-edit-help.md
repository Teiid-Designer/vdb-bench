### <p style="text-align: center">![Edit icon](images/EditIcon.png "Edit Data Service") Edit Data Service Page</p>

This page is used to edit a data service's data source, data source table, and description. The data service name cannot be changed.

If you would like to change the data source, select one of the the available data sources from the **Data Sources** list.

Then select the data source's table from the **Tables** list that provides the data you are looking for.

You may also just want to select a different table without changing the data source.

Click ![Save image](images/SaveIcon.png "Save Data Service") to make the changes to the data service. This will take you back to the [Data Service Summary](dataservices-summary-help.html) page.

Of course, you can hit the ![Cancel button](images/CancelButton.png "Cancel Edit Data Service") button if you change your mind and no longer wish to modify the data service. Canceling takes you back to the [Data Service Summary](dataservices-summary-help.html) page.
