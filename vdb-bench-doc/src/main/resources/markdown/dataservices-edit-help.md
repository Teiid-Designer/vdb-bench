### <p style="text-align: center">![Edit icon](images/EditIcon.png "Edit Data Service") Edit Data Service Page</p>

This page allows you to edit an existing data service.

* **Wizard Tab**
If the service view format is recognized, you will start on the Wizard tab.  Step through the wizard to view and change any information. 

* **Expert Tab**
If the service view format is not recognized, you will start on the Expert tab.  You can edit the view here or switch back to the Wizard tab to change the data service.

#### Wizard
The data service name cannot be changed, but you can edit the description (optional).

The available data sources are identified in the **Data Sources** list.  Expand the available sources to see the available tables.  You can cancel the currently selected tables and select a different table if you wish.

The wizard steps will change depending on whether you select one or two tables.  Currently the maximum number of tables you can select is two.  Once you have finished entering information, click ![Save Data Service image](images/FinishButton.png "Finish") to save your data service. This will take you to the [Data Service Summary](dataservices-summary-help.html) page, which will show all of your data services.

If the data source you are looking for does not exist, you can configure a new data source using available server connections.  Click on [![Configure Data Source image](images/ConfigureDataSource.png "Configure Data Source")](svcsource-new-help.html) to configure a new data source.

Of course, you can hit the ![Cancel button](images/CancelButton.png "Cancel Edit Data Service") button if you no longer wish to edit the data service. Canceling takes you to the [Data Service Summary](dataservices-summary-help.html) page.

#### Expert
You can switch from the Wizard to the Expert tab if at least one table is selected.
