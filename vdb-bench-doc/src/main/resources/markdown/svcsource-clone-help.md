### <p style="text-align: center">Copy Data Source Page</p>

This page is used to create a new data source from an existing one. The name of the data source being copied appears in the page title. For instance, the page title would say **Copy Data Source 'OracleParts'** if the **OracleParts** data source is being copied to create the new data source.
 
Once you enter the name of the new data source, hit the ![Create](images/CreateButton.png "Create Data Source") button to create the new data source. Of course, you can hit the ![Cancel button](images/CancelButton.png "Cancel Configure Data Source") button if you change your mind. 

The next page displayed is the [Data Source Summary page](datasource-summary-help.html). This page will show the new data source if one was successfully created.
