You can create a new data service by selecting a data source and a data table. Adding a data service description is optional.

The available data sources are identified in the **Data Sources** list.

If you see the data source you are looking for, go ahead and select it. This will display that data source's tables in the **Tables** list.

Now you can select the table that provides the data you are looking for. Once the table is selected, enter a name for the data service and click ![Create Data Service image](images/CreateButton.png "Create Data Service") to save your new data service. This will take you to the [Data Service Summary](dataservices-summary-help.html) page which will show the new data service if one was successfully created.

If the data source you are looking for does not exist, you can create it by using one of the existing connections on your server. Clicking [![Configure Data Source image](images/ConfigureDataSource.png "Configure Data Source")](svcsource-new-help.html) will take you to a page you can do that.

Of course, you can hit the ![Cancel button](images/CancelButton.png "Cancel Create Data Service") button if you change your mind and no longer wish to create a data service. Canceling displays the [Data Service Summary](dataservices-summary-help.html) page.
