### <p style="text-align: center">![New icon](images/NewIcon.png "New Data Service") New Data Service Page</p>

The Data service wizard will guide you through the process of creating a new data service. Enter a name for your data service.  A description (optional) can also be entered.

The available data sources are identified in the **Data Sources** list.  To select a table that provides the data of interest, expand the available sources and click a table.  It will then be added to the **Selected Tables** shown on the right.

The wizard steps will change depending on whether you select one or two tables.  Currently the maximum number of tables you can select is two.  Once you have finished entering information, click ![Create Data Service image](images/CreateButton.png "Create Data Service") to save your new data service. This will take you to the [Data Service Summary](dataservices-summary-help.html) page which will show the new data service if one was successfully created.

If the data source you are looking for does not exist, you can create it by using one of the existing connections on your server. Clicking [![Configure Data Source image](images/ConfigureDataSource.png "Configure Data Source")](svcsource-new-help.html) will take you to a page you can do that.

Of course, you can hit the ![Cancel button](images/CancelButton.png "Cancel Create Data Service") button if you change your mind and no longer wish to create a data service. Canceling displays the [Data Service Summary](dataservices-summary-help.html) page.
