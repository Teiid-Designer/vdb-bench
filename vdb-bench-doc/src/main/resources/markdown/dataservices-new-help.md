* **Wizard Tab**
The data service wizard will guide you through the process of creating a new data service. 

* **Expert Tab**
If you wish to enter the data service view definition directly, you can switch to the Expert tab after selecting your tables.  The expert tab will be populated with the View definition, which you can modify as desired.

#### Wizard
Enter a name for your data service.  You can also enter a description (optional).

The available data sources are identified in the **Data Sources** list.  Expand the available sources and click the table for your data service.  The table will be added to the **Selected Tables** shown on the right.  You can always cancel the selected tables and select a different table if you wish.

The wizard steps will change depending on whether you select one or two tables.  Currently the maximum number of tables you can select is two.  Once you have finished entering information, click ![Create Data Service image](images/FinishButton.png "Finish") to save your new data service. This will take you to the [Data Service Summary](dataservices-summary-help.html) page, which will show the new data service if one was successfully created.

If the data source you are looking for does not exist, you can configure a new data source using available server connections.  Click on [![Configure Data Source image](images/ConfigureDataSource.png "Configure Data Source")](svcsource-new-help.html) to configure a new data source.

Of course, you can hit the ![Cancel button](images/CancelButton.png "Cancel Create Data Service") button if you no longer wish to create a data service. Canceling takes you to the [Data Service Summary](dataservices-summary-help.html) page.

#### Expert
Enter a data service name and select the table(s) for your data service.  You can then switch to the Expert tab.
