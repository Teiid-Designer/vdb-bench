### <p style="text-align: center">![Copy icon](images/CopyIcon.png "Copy Data Service") Copy Data Service Page</p>

This page is used to create a new data service from an existing one. The name of the data service being copied appears in the page title. For instance, the page title would say **Copy Data Service 'Employees'** if the **Employees** data service is being copied to create the new data service.
 
Once you enter the name of the new data service, hit the ![Create](images/CreateButton.png "Create Data Service") button to create the new data service. Of course, you can hit the ![Cancel button](images/CancelButton.png "Cancel Create Data Service") button if you change your mind. 

The next page displayed is the [Data Service Summary page](dataservices-summary-help.html). This page will show the new data service if one was successfully created.
