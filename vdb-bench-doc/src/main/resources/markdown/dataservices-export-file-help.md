<br />

Once you select the export type, click ![Image of the next button](images/NextButton.png "Next Button") to take you to the next step of the wizard. The next step is different depending on if you are exporting to the file system or [exporting to a git repository](dataservices-export-git-help.html).

Since you've selected to perform a file export, the rest of this help page will talk about that type of export.

#### Export To File System 

When exporting to the file system, the wizard exports the data service you selected in the [Data Service Summary](dataservices-summary-help.html) page. Step 2 when exporting to a file looks like this:

After completing the wizard, you will be taken back to the [Data Service Summary](dataservices-summary-help.html) page.
