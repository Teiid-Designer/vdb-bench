### <p style="text-align: center">![New icon](images/NewIcon.png "New Data Service") New Data Service Page</p>

This page is used to create a new data service. However, in order to create a data service you must first have a data source. You can create a data source from one of the existing connections on your server.

Clicking [![New Data Source image](images/ConfigureDataSource.png "New Data Source")](svcsource-new-help.html) will take you to a page to do just that.
